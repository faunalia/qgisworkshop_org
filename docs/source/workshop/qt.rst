What it is
----------

Qt (pronounced:\  *cute* \) is an open-source application framework (a set of tools) developed by Trolltech for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and software. You've probably worked with Qt designed software if you've touched these programs: Google Earth, Virtual Box, Skype, Autodesk or Android smartphones. QGIS is also built on Qt -- that's why we're here.

The goal behind using an application framework like Qt is that it helps speed up the application development cycle. 

C++
---

Qt software is built using the C++ language, though other language bindings exist. The framework supports a number of C++ compilers from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to those in the Virtual Studio suite. It is therefore a framework that can be used to build applications on many different operating systems (cross-platform). 

Nokia
-----

Nokia Corporation, the company that actively controls the development of Qt, is a global communication firm based in Finland. Nokia has many well-known subsidiaries, one of which is Navteq.
